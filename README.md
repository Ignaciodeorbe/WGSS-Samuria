Name: 

Description: 
As our protagonist, Kai, is travelling between villages, he waits at a riverbed to drink some water. Thunder rumbles, it seems it is about to rain. As the rain starts to pour, he hears footsteps approaching. He dodges to the side and sees that his lifelong nemesis, is here to finish their story once and for all.
The two engage in battle, with both having their own unique style of fighting. Kai (you), are a master at evasion and parrying. You catch blades by clapping and are a pacifist. Shai (nemesis), is a master of throwing blades. His resources of blades seem to never run out. He swears to get the better of you.
Having two completely opposite styles, you're stuck in a deadlock until you die or Shai gives up.

Gameplay: Time your key presses to catch the thrown blade by clapping. Figure out the patterns and the speed on the incoming blades. One mistake and your head falls off. Build a highscore in this endless loop of catching blades just by clapping.
